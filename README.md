# laureates
## Usage
```bash
bash pick.sh
```

will pick a random Nobel laureate.

### update the laureates

```bash
bash get-nobel.sh
```

will use the Nobel API to pull down a list of all of the winners to date.

## Why?
I use this to name characters in games, it is fun to read about the laureate while I play.
